# How many samples to estimate a convolution filter.
Here, I'll run some quick experiments to test the claims made by [How many samples regarding the representation ability of a convolution filter](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7320-how-many-samples-are-needed-to-estimate-a-convolutional-neural-network). This will help me better understand how CNNs are superior to their fully connected counterparts.

Result: While I couldn't quite get the exactly same results as theirs, I did find similar relationships between CNN error and number of samples used through my implementation. That said, only if the details of the experiment such as the training targets used were made clearer I can get better matching results.
